Probabilistic Crowd Analysis

Analyzed real pedestrian data using the pair-distribution function. Zipped file crowd.zip, 
contains a pedestrian dataset that uses a csv format.

Computed the pair distribution function 'g' as a function of pairwise
time-to-collision values ('tau'), and estimated the corresponding “interaction energy" graph.
