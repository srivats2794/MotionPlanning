Real-Time Safe Navigation in Crowded Dynamic Environments Using Generalized Velocity Obstacles  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 	 
We aim at developing a real-time navigation method for a car like agent, the so-called simple car with x,y and theta as states 
and steering angle as input. To this end, a local motion planner will be introduced which combining the Generalized Velocity 
Obstacles (GVO) notion and a suitable controller so that the inevitable collision states can successfully be avoided. 
The proposed method considers only the kinematics of the robot and not its dynamics. 

Finally, in order to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed motion planner for the steered robot, 
we plan to use it on either an actual F1-Tenth (scaled down steered vehicle) which we use in our lab or in simulation(Gazebo). 
Some realistic and challenging scenarios with dynamic obstacles can be setup and the vehicle with 
the algorithm can be tested in these scenarios.
